Computerized Adaptive Testing

# Why CAT?

Reduces the number of "easy" items that high-ability candidates receive; "easy" items tell little about a high performing candidate's ability. Reduces the number of "difficult" items low-ability candidates receive; candidates tend to guess on items that are too difficult which can skew results. Reduces item exposure and subsequent security risks. Improves precision of measurement of the candidate's ability related to test and provides a valid and reliable measurement of competence .

# How Does CAT Work?

Every time you answer an item, the computer re-estimates your ability based on all the previous answers and the difficulty of those items. The computer then selects the next item that you should have a 50% chance of answering correctly. This way, the next item should not be too easy or too hard. The computer's goal is to get as much information as possible about your true ability level. You should find each item challenging as each item is targeted to your ability. With each item answered, the computer's estimate of your ability becomes more precise.
